# Project1 Part 2

DESCRIPTION: In part 2, the equation for the period of a pendulum is used to calculate the 
expected period durations for a pendulum at five different lengths.

INSTRUCTIONS: The function takes an array of lengths as a pendulum and returns the expected period for each one. So, the lengths of the pendulums can be adjusted in this 
array to give different period values.
