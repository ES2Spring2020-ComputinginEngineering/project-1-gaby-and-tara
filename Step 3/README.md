DESCRIPTION:This step contains the code used to collect the real-world pendulum data. It contains code for two different microbits that communicate in order to record and 
store the data for the pendulum model.

INSTRUCTIONS: The logger code should be run on on the microbit attached to the 
pendulum, and the receiver code should be run on a seperate microbit that is connected to a 
computer.
