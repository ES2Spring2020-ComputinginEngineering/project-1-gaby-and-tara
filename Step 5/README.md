# Project1 Part 5 

NAME(S): Gaby Ackermann Logan and Tara Donohue 

DESCRIPTION: This step creates a simulation of a pendulum with the same lengths that
were used in the real-world trials.

INSTRUCTIONS:The simulation takes in a starting angle, a run time, and lengths to be tested at. From there, it will generate graphs to simulate the motion of the pendulum 
and calculate its theoretical period durations.
